# Exporting for Android

See also

This page describes how to export a Godot project to Android.
If you're looking to compile export template binaries from source instead,
read [Compiling for Android](../../engine_details/development/compiling/compiling_for_android.md#doc-compiling-for-android).

Exporting for Android has fewer requirements than compiling Godot for Android.
The following steps detail what is needed to set up the Android SDK and the engine.

Attention

Projects written in C# can be exported to Android as of Godot 4.2, but support
is experimental and [some limitations apply](../scripting/c_sharp/index.md#doc-c-sharp-platforms).

## Setup on Android

When exporting to Android from the Android editor, you do **not** need to
install OpenJDK or the Android SDK when exporting to Android, regardless of the
export method used (pre-built APK or Gradle build).

However, if you are performing a Gradle build, you will need to follow some
steps described in [Gradle builds for Android](android_gradle_build.md#doc-android-gradle-build).

You can then skip to [Providing launcher icons](exporting_for_android.md#doc-exporting-for-android-providing-launcher-icons).

## Setup on Windows, macOS, and Linux

<a id="install-openjdk-17"></a>

### Install OpenJDK 17

Download and install [OpenJDK 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?variant=openjdk17&version=17&os=any&arch=any).

Note

Higher versions of the JDK are also supported, but we recommend using JDK 17 for optimal compatibility and stability.

<a id="download-the-android-sdk"></a>

### Download the Android SDK

Download and install the Android SDK.

- You can install the Android SDK using [Android Studio Iguana (version 2023.2.1) or later](https://developer.android.com/studio/).

  - Run it once to complete the SDK setup using these [instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update#sdk-manager).
  - Ensure that the [required packages](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update#required) are installed as well.

    - Android SDK Platform-Tools version 35.0.0 or later
    - Android SDK Build-Tools version 35.0.1
    - Android SDK Platform 35
    - Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)
  - Ensure that the [NDK and CMake are installed and configured](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk).

    - CMake version 3.10.2.4988404
    - NDK version r28b (28.1.13356709)
- Alternatively, you can install the Android SDK with the sdkmanager command line tool.

  - Install the command line tools package using these [instructions](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdkmanager).
  - Once the command line tools are installed, run the following sdkmanager command to complete the setup process:

```gdscript
sdkmanager --sdk_root=<android_sdk_path> "platform-tools" "build-tools;35.0.1" "platforms;android-35" "cmdline-tools;latest" "cmake;3.10.2.4988404" "ndk;28.1.13356709"
```

Note

If you are using Linux,
**do not use an Android SDK provided by your distribution's repositories as it will often be outdated**.

<a id="setting-it-up-in-godot"></a>

### Setting it up in Godot

Enter the Editor Settings screen (under the Godot tab for macOS, or the Editor tab
for other platforms). This screen contains the editor settings for the user
account in the computer (it's independent of the project).

![../../_images/editorsettings.webp](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.7/_images/editorsettings.webp)

Scroll down to the section where the Android settings are located:

![../../_images/android_editor_settings.webp](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.7/_images/android_editor_settings.webp)

In that screen, 2 paths need to be set:

- `Java SDK Path` should be the location where OpenJDK 17 was installed.
- `Android SDK Path` should be the location where the Android SDK was installed. This directory should contain `platform-tools/adb`.
  - For example `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk\` on Windows or `/Users/$USER/Library/Android/sdk/` on macOS.

Once that is configured, everything is ready to export to Android!

Note

If you get an error saying *"Could not install to device."*, make sure
you do not have an application with the same Android package name already
installed on the device (but signed with a different key).

If you have an application with the same Android package name but a
different signing key already installed on the device, you **must** remove
the application in question from the Android device before exporting to
Android again.

<a id="doc-exporting-for-android-providing-launcher-icons"></a>

## Providing launcher icons

Launcher icons are used by Android launcher apps to represent your application to users. Godot only requires high-resolution icons (for `xxxhdpi` density screens) and will automatically generate lower-resolution variants.

There are three types of icons:

- **Main Icon:** The "classic" icon. This will be used on all Android versions up to Android 8 (Oreo), exclusive. Must be at least 192×192 px.
- **Adaptive Icons:** Starting from Android 8 (inclusive), [Adaptive Icons](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/system/icon_design_adaptive) were introduced. Applications will need to include separate background and foreground icons to have a native look. The user's launcher application will control the icon's animation and masking. Must be at least 432×432 px.
- **Themed Icons (optional):** Starting from Android 13 (inclusive), Themed Icons were introduced. Applications will need to include a monochrome icon to enable this feature. The user's launcher application will control the icon's theme. Must be at least 432×432 px.

See also

It's important to adhere to some rules when designing adaptive icons. [Google Design has provided a nice article](https://medium.com/google-design/designing-adaptive-icons-515af294c783) that helps to understand those rules and some of the capabilities of adaptive icons.

Caution

The most important adaptive icon design rule is to have your icon critical elements inside the safe zone: a centered circle with a diameter of 66dp (264 pixels on `xxxhdpi`) to avoid being clipped by the launcher.

If you don't provide the requested icons (except for Monochrome), Godot will replace them using a fallback chain, trying the next in line when the current one fails:

- **Main Icon:** Provided main icon -> Project icon -> Default Godot main icon.
- **Adaptive Icon Foreground:** Provided foreground icon -> Provided main icon -> Project icon -> Default Godot foreground icon.
- **Adaptive Icon Background:** Provided background icon -> Default Godot background icon.

It's highly recommended to provide all the requested icons with their specified resolutions.
This way, your application will look great on all Android devices and versions.

## Exporting for Google Play Store

All new apps uploaded to Google Play after August 2021 must be an AAB (Android App Bundle)
file. To export an AAB file you need to set up [Gradle builds for Android](android_gradle_build.md#doc-android-gradle-build).

Uploading an AAB or APK to Google's Play Store requires you to sign using a non-debug
keystore file; such a file can be generated like this:

```shell
keytool -v -genkey -keystore mygame.keystore -alias mygame -keyalg RSA -validity 10000
```

This keystore and key are used to verify your developer identity, remember the password and keep it in a safe place!
It is suggested to use only upper and lowercase letters and numbers. Special characters may cause errors.
Use Google's Android Developer guides to learn more about [app signing](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing).

Now fill in the following forms in your Android Export Presets:

![../../_images/editor-export-presets-android.webp](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.7/_images/editor-export-presets-android.webp)

- **Release:** Enter the path to the keystore file you just generated.
- **Release User:** Replace with the key alias.
- **Release Password:** Key password. Note that the keystore password and the key password currently have to be the same.

Don't forget to uncheck the **Export With Debug** checkbox while exporting.

<a id="optimizing-the-file-size"></a>

## Optimizing the file size

You can optimize the size of your application by compiling an Android export
template with only the features you need. See [Optimizing a build for size](../../engine_details/development/compiling/optimizing_for_size.md#doc-optimizing-for-size) for
more information.

<a id="performing-a-custom-gradle-build"></a>

## Performing a custom Gradle build

If you need to modify the template's Java code or integrate with third-party
Android SDKs, you may want to use a custom Gradle build instead of the default
pre-built APK template. This allows you to have more control over the build
process and the generated project, and you can use it as a base for further
customization.

See [Gradle builds for Android](android_gradle_build.md#doc-android-gradle-build) for guidance on setting up a custom Gradle build.

<a id="environment-variables"></a>

## Environment variables

You can use the following environment variables to set export options outside of
the editor. During the export process, these override the values that you set in
the export menu.

<a id="id1"></a>

Android export environment variables

| Export option | Environment variable |
| --- | --- |
| Encryption / Encryption Key | `GODOT_SCRIPT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` |
| Options / Keystore / Debug | `GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_DEBUG_PATH` |
| Options / Keystore / Debug User | `GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_DEBUG_USER` |
| Options / Keystore / Debug Password | `GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_DEBUG_PASSWORD` |
| Options / Keystore / Release | `GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_RELEASE_PATH` |
| Options / Keystore / Release User | `GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_RELEASE_USER` |
| Options / Keystore / Release Password | `GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_RELEASE_PASSWORD` |

<a id="export-options"></a>

## Export options

You can find a full list of export options available in the
[EditorExportPlatformAndroid](../../classes/class_editorexportplatformandroid.md#class-editorexportplatformandroid) class reference.
