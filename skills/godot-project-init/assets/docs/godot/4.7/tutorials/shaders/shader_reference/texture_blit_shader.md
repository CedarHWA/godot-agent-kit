# Texture blit shaders

Texture blit shaders are used to define the behavior of blit calls on a
[DrawableTexture2D](../../rendering/drawable_textures.md#doc-drawable-textures).

Texture blit shaders only have one processing function, the `blit()` function,
which runs for every pixel of the source texture inside the rect given to
`blit_rect()`.

See also

See [Using DrawableTextures](../../rendering/drawable_textures.md#doc-drawable-textures) for more information on how to use texture
blit shaders as part of a DrawableTexture.

## Render modes

| Render mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **blend_disabled** | Disable blending, values (including alpha) are written as-is. Default. |
| **blend_mix** | Mix blend mode (alpha is transparency). |
| **blend_add** | Additive blend mode. |
| **blend_sub** | Subtractive blend mode. |
| **blend_mul** | Multiplicative blend mode. |

Note

There is no premultiplied alpha blend mode for Texture blit shaders.

## Built-ins

Values marked as `in` are read-only. Values marked as `out` can optionally be written to and will
not necessarily contain sensible values. Values marked as `inout` provide a sensible default
value, and can optionally be written to. Samplers cannot be written to so they are not marked.

## Global built-ins

Global built-ins are available everywhere, including custom functions.

| Built-in | Description |
| --- | --- |
| in float **TIME** | Global time since the engine has started, in seconds. It repeats after every `3,600` seconds (which can be changed with the [rollover](../../../classes/class_projectsettings.md#class-projectsettings-property-rendering-limits-time-time-rollover-secs) setting). It's affected by [time_scale](../../../classes/class_engine.md#class-engine-property-time-scale) but not by pausing. If you need a `TIME` variable that is not affected by time scale, add your own [global shader uniform](shading_language.md#doc-shading-language-global-uniforms) and update it each frame. |
| in float **PI** | A `PI` constant (`3.141592`). The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter and the number of radians in a half turn. |
| in float **TAU** | A `TAU` constant (`6.283185`). An equivalent of `PI * 2` and amount of radians in full turn. |
| in float **E** | An `E` constant (`2.718281`). Euler's number and a base of the natural logarithm. |

### Source textures

Texture blit shaders have up to 4 source textures bound as inputs. These can be
accessed with a `sampler2D` using `hint_blit_source0`,
`hint_blit_source1`, `hint_blit_source2`, and `hint_blit_source3`.

| Built-in | Description |
| --- | --- |
| in vec4 **FRAGCOORD** | Coordinate of pixel center. In screen space. `xy` specifies position in viewport. Upper-left of the viewport is the origin, `(0.0, 0.0)`. |
| in vec2 **UV** | UV from the `vertex()` function. This is set to sample all of a source texture. |
| in vec4 **MODULATE** | `MODULATE` color passed in by RenderingServer API. |
| out vec4 **COLOR0** | Output color to blended with the DrawableTexture target. Initialized to `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. |
| out vec4 **COLOR1** | Output color to blended with an extra DrawableTexture target. Initialized to `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. |
| out vec4 **COLOR2** | Output color to blended with an extra DrawableTexture target. Initialized to `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. |
| out vec4 **COLOR3** | Output color to blended with an extra DrawableTexture target. Initialized to `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. |
